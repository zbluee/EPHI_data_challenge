Further research is needed to understand the burden of this diseases in Ethiopia and address this issue such as vaccines development.

It is well known that folate deficiency in pregnant women has a potential for impact on the prevalence of these neural tube defects and then to avoid them, adequate level of folic acid in mother's blood should be at the time of conception. However, Ethiopia is one of the few countries in Africa with no folic acid fortification. So, there is an urgency to implement effective programs to get all women of reproductive age to have adequate folic acid to prevent all of folic acid-preventable spina bifida and anencephaly, which would prevent 96% of spina bifida and anencephaly cases.

Most cases of spina bifida can be prevented if the mother gets enough folate before and during pregnancy.  Adding folic acid to flour has been found to be effective for most women or take ready to use folic acid pills. In order to treat a maternal infection avoiding the transmission to the baby in the next pregnancy, the mother should go to a health facility if she feels fever, vaginal discharge or some signs of urinary tract infection (burning feeling when you pee, a frequent or intense urge to pee, even though little comes out when you do, cloudy, dark, bloody, or strange-smelling urine, feeling tired or shaky, pain or pressure in your back or lower abdomen) to be treated as soon as possible and avoid the transmission to the baby.

Once the mother is pregnant, if she does not have enough folic acid in their blood, the baby will not develop well his/her brain and this damage cannot be prevented. The mother should take 5mg of folic acid daily (currently costs 1 ETB/tablet) from now up to end of reproductive age (increased risk of a second NTD).     Advise for health facility:  This severe neural tube defect could be detected very early during pregnancy and avoid the family early termination of pregnancy. This mother did not do any ANC. ANC attending is poor and more community engagement and awareness on institutional deliveries and ANC is needed to diagnosis early growth restriction and avoid complications associated to it.     Advise for health authorities: Neural tube defect is very prevalent in Ethiopia, and anencephaly is the most severe clinical presentation with fatal outcome. It is well known that folate deficiency in pregnant women has a potential for impact on the prevalence of these neural tube defects and then to avoid them, adequate level of folic acid in mother's blood should be at the time of conception. However, Ethiopia is one of the few countries in Africa with no folic acid fortification.

Once the mother is pregnant, if she does not have enough vitamins in their blood, the baby will not develop well his/her brain and this damage cannot be prevented. Most neural tube defect cases including anencephaly can be prevented if the mother gets enough folate before and early stage of pregnancy.  Health-seeking behavior, saving money for delivery, good nutrition, and early initiation of ANC helps in preventing similar kinds of problems.  Advice for health facility:  this severe neural tube defect could be detected earlier in the pregnancy and advised the mother to do a closer follow-up. Spina bifida caused hydrocephalus, which made difficult the delivery. With better ANC care and early diagnosis of NTDs, a planned early termination of pregnancy to avoid intrauterine fetal distress could be done. Spina bifida can be corrected after birth and it does not necessarily cause death.   Advice for health authorities: neural tube defect is very prevalent in Ethiopia, and spina bifida is the most common clinical presentation. It is well known that folate deficiency in pregnant women has the potential to impact the prevalence of these neural tube defects and then to avoid them, an adequate level of folic acid in the mother's blood should be at the time of conception. However, Ethiopia is one of the few countries in Africa with no folic acid fortification. Therefore, there is an urgency to implement effective programs to get all women of reproductive age to have adequate folic acid to prevent all folic acid-preventable spina bifida and anencephaly, which would prevent the majority of spina bifida and anencephaly cases.

Once the mother is pregnant, if she does not have enough folic acid in their blood, the baby will not develop well his/her brain and this damage cannot be prevented. Most cases of spina bifida can be prevented if the mother gets enough folate before and during pregnancy.    Advise for health facility:   pre-pregnancy folate supplementation and education on consuming folate rich food helps to prevent NTD. It is also defected early in the pregnancy and advice the mother to do a closer follow-up. Spina bifida caused hydrocephalus that made difficult the delivery.  Spina bifida can be corrected after birth and it does not necessarily cause death. IPC should be intensify in the hospital and appropriate clinical management of invasive bacterial diseases.  Advise for health authorities:, there is an urgency to implement effective programs to get all women of reproductive age to have adequate folic acid to prevent all of folic acid-preventable spina bifida and anencephaly, which would prevent majority of spina bifida and anencephaly cases.  The most effective one would be mandatory food fortification program.

Once the mother is pregnant, if she does not have enough folic acid in their blood, the baby will not develop well his/her brain and this damage cannot be prevented. Most cases of spina bifida can be prevented if the mother gets enough folate before and during pregnancy.    Advise for health facility:   pre-pregnancy folate supplementation and education on consuming folate rich food helps to prevent NTD. It is also defected early in the pregnancy and advice the mother to do a closer follow-up. Spina bifida caused hydrocephalus that made difficult the delivery. With a better ANC care and early diagnosed of hydrocephalus, a planned delivery or C-section to avoid intrauterine fetal distress could be done. Spina bifida can be corrected after birth and it does not necessarily cause death.  Advise for health authorities:, there is an urgency to implement effective programs to get all women of reproductive age to have adequate folic acid to prevent all of folic acid-preventable spina bifida and anencephaly, which would prevent majority of spina bifida and anencephaly ",2,7,CH00735,18/05/2022,Q00.1,CH00002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P03.0,CH01711,CH00002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P07.1,CH00002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0
